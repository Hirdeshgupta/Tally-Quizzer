### Method 1 (recommended): Using Docker

#### Pre-requisites

1. Install `Docker` by looking up the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Install `Docker Compose` by looking up the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Steps

1. Make sure you are inside the root of the project (i.e., `./Tally-Quizzer/` folder).
2. Setup environment variables in `.env` files of all folders according to `.env.sample` files.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to spin up the containers.
4. The website would then be available locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.
5. The above command could be run in detached mode with `-d` flag as `docker-compose up -d`.
6. For help, run the command `docker-compose -h`.

### Method 2

#### Pre-requisites

1. Install `concurrently` by running `npm run pre-install` on terminal.

#### Steps

1. Make sure you are inside the root of the project (i.e., `./Tally-Quizzer/` folder).
2. Setup environment variables in `.env` files of all folders according to `.env.sample` files.
3. Run `npm run start-with-install` to install all the dependencies and run frontend and backend concurrently.
4. The website would then be available locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.
5. If you have already installed the dependencies, you can also run `npm run start` to run the frontend and backend concurrently.

### Method 3 : Setup services independently

#### Pre-requisites
1. Download and Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Setup Node Backend

1. Run `cd .\backend` to go inside the Node.js server folder for Windows or
Run `cd backend` to go inside the Node.js server folder for Linux.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create a new file named `.env` and add the environment variables according to `.env.sample` file.
5. Run `npm start` to start the node backend server.

#### Setup Frontend

1. Run `cd frontend` to go inside the frontend folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Create a new file named `.env` and add the environment variables according to `.env.sample` file.
4. Run `npm start` to start the frontend backend server.
