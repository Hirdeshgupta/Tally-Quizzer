## Tools and Technology


The front end is created in **React.js** and **Material UI**. For creating backend, we used **Nodejs**. For the database, we used Google Firebase. We created a very flexible and versatile foundation for our codebase, so that in future its functionality could be easily extended and new agents could be easily added into it.

origin	git@github.com:<username>/Tally-Quizzer.git (push)
```
Add upstream to remote:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MiHarsh/Tally-Quizzer.git (https)
```
or
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:MiHarsh/Tally-Quizzer.git (ssh)
```

```
## Installation or Dev Setup

### Method 1 :

#### Pre-requisites

1. Install `concurrently` by running `npm run pre-install` on terminal.

#### Steps

1. Make sure you are inside the root of the project (i.e., `./Tally-Quizzer/` folder).
2. Setup environment variables in `.env` files of all folders according to `.env.sample` files.
3. Run `npm run start-with-install` to install all the dependencies and run frontend and backend concurrently.
4. The website would then be available locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.
5. If you have already installed the dependencies, you can also run `npm run start` to run the frontend and backend concurrently.

### Method 2 : Setup services independently

#### Pre-requisites
1. Download and Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Setup Node Backend

1. Run `cd .\backend` to go inside the Node.js server folder for Windows or
Run `cd backend` to go inside the Node.js server folder for Linux.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create a new file named `.env` and add the environment variables according to `.env.sample` file.
5. Run `npm start` to start the node backend server.

#### Setup Frontend

1. Run `cd frontend` to go inside the frontend folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Create a new file named `.env` and add the environment variables according to `.env.sample` file.
